# UMeet

UMeet is a web application used to book meeting/event spaces around campus, specifically for student organizations and RSO's to book classrooms more easily. This web app will include functionality for users to create an account, view available meeting rooms, learn details about each room, and book a room for a specific date and time slot. 

There is an existing web application for booking group study rooms in the W. E. B. Du Bois Library (https://libcal.library.umass.edu/reserve/groupstudyrooms). However, these rooms provided by the library have a maximum capacity of 6-8 students which are too small for RSO and student organization meetings. If a student organization in CICS or a campus RSO would like to book a classroom for meetings in the Integrated Learning Center, Isenberg School of Management Building, or any other classroom building on campus, they currently have to go through an extensive process of reaching out to CCM administration or submitting an application to Campus Pulse. 

Our goal is to create a standardized and efficient web platform which will make it easier for student organizations and RSOs to book meeting spaces in order to host their events in a standardized and articulate manner.

The room details available to view include: room type, rating, attendee capacity, technology available, building acronym, specific room tags, and finally, a room address and Google Maps API integration.                                                            |
